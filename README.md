# 🔍 Search Algorithms in Java

This repository contains simple Java implementations of search algorithms, aimed at helping beginners understand the logic behind common searching techniques.

## 📂 What’s Inside

- `LinearSearch.java` – Basic linear search through an unsorted array.
- `BinarySearch.java` – Efficient binary search on a sorted array.
- `LinearBinarySearch.java` – User-driven program that lets you pick between linear or binary search.

## 🚀 Features

- Accepts user input via `Scanner`
- Demonstrates core search logic with clean code
- Handles sorted and unsorted data sets
- Console-based interaction for easy understanding

## 🧠 Why This Repo Exists

Just a basic collection of foundational search algorithms. If you’re a beginner, this code is a good place to start. If you’re brushing up, it’s a quick refresher. Either way, it’s a core skill every dev should have in the bag.
